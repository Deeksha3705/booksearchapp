### How long did you spend on the coding assignment ###
I spent around 7 - 8 hours on this project

### what would you do to your soulution if you had more time ###
I would have implemented some features like pagination, accurate data checking and more

### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it. ###
Developed the project using modern javascript and react hooks - {arrow functions, functional components, useState}

### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this? ###
In the previous project where I worked we used this SENTRY Application (used for App Monoitoring and Error Tracking).
So we used to track the logs every biweekly and used to resolve the defects which Impacts according to the priority basis


### How would you improve the API that you just used? ###
According to my opinion there is no perfect application which doesn't require improvements.
But in particular to this API - If there was a bit clear documentation it would have helped in understading a bit faster like examples, notes or repos.
Most of the links which are at the website were showing 404 
It gave me a hard time finidng what and what

Better documentation, Navigation, and Examples are the major parts I would have concentrated and further improvement in payload
